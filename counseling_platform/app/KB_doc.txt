Expectations from a mentor
Socio-Emotional Support: The most common and impactful function, mentors provide encouragement, motivation, and a sense of belonging. This support is crucial for students navigating the challenges of adolescence and preparing for college.
Cognitive/Academic Support: Mentors help students develop academic skills, such as study strategies, subject-specific knowledge, and critical thinking. This is particularly important for students who may be academically underprepared for college-level work.
Identity Development and Role Modeling: Mentors assist students in setting goals, exploring career paths, and envisioning their futures. They serve as positive role models, helping students build aspirations and a sense of purpose.
Tangible Support: In some cases, mentors may provide practical help, such as advice on college applications, financial aid, or even transportation and resources, especially for students with fewer family resources.
Building Social Capital: Mentors can help students develop social skills and networks, which are essential for college adjustment and long-term success
Motivation for mentorship
Mentorship is one of the most powerful relationships for growth and transformation—both for the mentee and the mentor. However, the effectiveness of mentorship largely depends on why the mentor chooses to engage in the first place. Motivation matters. When driven by authentic, purpose-oriented intentions, mentorship becomes a force for empowerment rather than a transactional obligation. Below, we explore the ideal motivations for mentors and the underlying principles that make these relationships meaningful and impactful.
1. Altruistic and Developmental Motivation
Best mentors are intrinsically motivated by a desire to give back, support the next generation, and help others grow.
Great mentors are not motivated by self-promotion or accolades; instead, they find fulfillment in helping others succeed.
This motivation aligns with Erik Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, particularly the stage of Generativity vs. Stagnation, where individuals seek to create a positive legacy by nurturing the next generation.
When mentors approach the relationship as an opportunity to invest in someone’s future, they become catalysts for change—not just in individual lives, but in entire communities.
2. Relational and Reciprocal Benefit
Effective mentorship is not one-sided; both mentor and mentee learn and benefit from the relationship.The most successful mentors recognize that mentorship is a two-way learning process, where they gain fresh perspectives, develop leadership and communication skills, and even challenge their own assumptions.
This concept resonates with Social Exchange Theory, which suggests that relationships thrive when there is reciprocity. Mentors who embrace reverse mentoring—learning from younger or differently experienced mentees—enhance their adaptability and cultural intelligence. Ultimately, mentorship becomes a space for shared curiosity and growth, rather than a rigid hierarchy.
Ideal motivation includes an openness to:
Learning from the mentee (reverse mentoring)
Enhancing one's own leadership and communication skills
Expanding one’s own network and perspective
3. Commitment to Equity and Inclusion
Research stresses the need for mentors to be motivated by fairness and a desire to counter structural inequities.Structural inequalities often limit opportunities for individuals from marginalized or underrepresented groups.
The best mentors recognize the disproportionate barriers faced by underrepresented groups and are motivated to be allies or advocates.
Frameworks like Critical Mentoring (Weiston-Serdan) emphasize the need for culturally responsive, justice-oriented mentorship. This requires humility, self-awareness, and a willingness to use one’s privilege to create access for others.
When mentors are driven by the belief that talent is universal but opportunity is not, they become active agents of change, helping dismantle cycles of exclusion and inequity.
 4. Support for Career and Identity Development
Mentors should be motivated by the desire to empower mentees to discover their potential—not dictate their path.Good mentors are driven by the goal of helping mentees:
Develop professional skills
Explore and solidify career identities
Gain confidence and agency
These motivations align with Social Cognitive Career Theory, which emphasizes how mentorship shapes self-efficacy and career aspirations. By fostering these beliefs, mentors help mentees expand their vision of what’s possible and take ownership of their aspirations.
The Ideal Mindset
In essence, the best mentors are motivated by service, reciprocity, justice, and growth. They approach mentorship as a partnership—walking beside the mentee, not ahead or behind—providing guidance while honoring autonomy. They create a safe, inclusive space where stories are heard, confidence is built, and futures are rewritten.
Mentorship is not just about sharing knowledge; it is about igniting potential and shaping lives with empathy, integrity, and purpose.
✅ What To Do as a Mentor:
✔ Listen before advising – Understand the mentee’s context, challenges, and aspirations.
✔ Empower, don’t dictate – Guide by asking questions, not by imposing decisions.
✔ Practice cultural humility – Be aware of social and cultural dynamics that shape the mentee’s life.
✔ Share opportunities – Introduce mentees to networks, resources, and practical tools.
✔ Encourage self-reflection – Help them discover answers within, not rely entirely on you.
✔ Model integrity and empathy – Be consistent, reliable, and non-judgmental.
✔ Stay curious and open to learning – Embrace reverse mentoring.
✖ What Not to Be Motivated By:
✖ Don’t use mentorship for ego or status – It’s not about showcasing your achievements.
✖ Don’t “fix” the mentee – They are not broken; they need guidance, not control.
✖ Don’t make it transactional – Mentorship isn’t a box to tick for promotions or funding.
✖ Don’t dominate the relationship – Avoid one-way communication; respect autonomy.
✖ Don’t impose your path – What worked for you may not work for them; focus on exploration, not replication.
✖ Don’t ignore systemic challenges – Recognize structural barriers and help navigate them.
✖ Don’t overpromise or underdeliver – Consistency builds trust.
Best Practices for Impactful Mentorship
Build Trust First: Clarify expectations and boundaries.
Start with Stories: Encourage personal narratives to understand identity.
Show Up Consistently: Reliability builds confidence.
Celebrate Small Wins: Progress matters more than perfection.
Practice Cultural Humility: Be aware of your own biases.
Stay Curious: Learn from your mentee.
Culturally Sensitive Mentorship
Mentorship in diverse contexts requires cultural intelligence.
Apply Critical Mentoring Principles: Center the mentee’s identity and lived experience.
Understand Intersectionality: Race, gender, class, and language shape realities (Crenshaw).
Avoid Savior Complex: You’re a partner, not a rescuer.
Mentorship Models
One-on-One Mentorship: Personalized, story-driven engagement.
Group Mentorship: Community-based growth and peer support.
Reverse Mentoring: Younger voices teaching senior professionals adaptability.
Our Model: Own The Story prioritizes personalized, story-based mentorship, blending cultural heritage and modern guidance.
The Mentorship Mindset Framework
To be an effective mentor, embody this three-pillar framework:
1. Empathy: Listen actively. Understand the mentee’s context, struggles, and dreams.
2. Empowerment: Guide through questions, not directives. Give tools, not answers.
3. Equity: Acknowledge barriers. Help mentees access opportunities without judgment.
Framework for conduct
At the initial stages of the match, your mentee may appear to be hesitant, unresponsive, and unappreciative of the mentor relationship. This guarded attitude is simply a manifestation of his/her insecurity about the relationship. The mentee’s attitude will gradually take a positive turn as he/she realizes your sincerity about being a friend. Be patient! Don’t try to speed up the process by going out of your way to accommodate your mentee, such as seeing your mentee more than the prescribed one hour per week.
Remember that the mentor–mentee relationship has an initial phase. During this phase the mentee is more interested in getting to know how “real” you are and how much he/she can trust you. Establish how you can reach your mentee: by phone, e-mail, or fax or at a designated meeting location. Experience proves that calling or emailing your mentee at school is usually the best way to make contact. Establish a time and phone number where you can usually answer calls or make contact. Mentees need encouragement to leave messages on your voicemail to confirm meetings as well as to cancel them.
Don’t try to be a teacher, parent, disciplinarian, therapist, Santa Claus or babysitter. Experience demonstrates it is counterproductive to assume roles other than a dependable, consistent friend. Present information carefully without distortion and give all points of view a fair hearing. Listen carefully and offer possible solutions without passing judgment. Don’t criticize or preach. Think of ways to problem solve together rather than lecturing or telling the mentee what to do. Never “should have” your mentee.
Respect the uniqueness and honor the integrity of your mentee and influence him/her through constructive feedback. The mentor empowers the mentee to make right decisions without actually deciding for the mentee. Identify the mentee’s interests and take them seriously. Be alert for opportunities and teaching moments. Explore positive and negative consequences.
Set realistic expectations and goals for your mentee and make achievement for them fun. Remember there is a big difference between encouraging and demanding. Encourage your mentee to complete his/her secondary education and pursue higher learning or vocational goals; provide access to varying points of view. Assist in making the connection between his/her actions of today and the dreams and goals of tomorrow. Don’t get discouraged if the mentee isn’t turning his/her life around or making great improvements. Mentors have a great deal of impact; it’s not always immediately evident. Look for signs such as increased school attendance, improved grades, showing up for meetings and expressing appreciation.
As a friend you can share and advise, but know your limitations. Problems that your mentee may share with you regarding substance abuse, molestation and physical abuse are best handled by professionals. If you have any concerns, contact the mentor coordinator immediately.
Be supportive of the parent, even when you may disagree. Don’t take sides or make judgments concerning any family conflict or situation. Leave the parenting to the parent.
There may be instances when your mentee’s behavior is unacceptable. Again, remember the parent is responsible for the child’s discipline. The following guidelines are to be used if the parent is not around to assume the responsibility for the child’s behavior. Don’t forget to inform the parent about the steps you took and why you took them.
Don’t use physical means to discipline.
Never use abusive language.
Don’t use ultimatums.
Most children will listen and respond to reason. Explain to your mentee why you find his/her behavior unacceptable.
Don’t give your mentee the silent treatment to solve the problem. Discuss your concerns.
If you have become aware that your mentee’s safety or the safety of another is in jeopardy through disclosure (e.g., child abuse, sexual abuse), report your concern to the mentor coordinator or teacher immediately. Let your mentee know that you are required to do so. This requirement should always be discussed at the beginning of the relationship to inform the mentee of your obligation to report safety concerns.
Entertainment is not the focal point of your relationship. Do not spend an exorbitant amount of money for activities, birthday presents, and so on.
Discussions between you and your mentee are considered confidential. Be careful about sensitive personal issues. The mentee’s personal or family life may be difficult to discuss, particularly early in the relationship. Your mentee may be ashamed of poor school performance, family culture and religion, financial problems and so on. It is important not to measure the success of the relationship by the extent of the mentee’s disclosure.
Strategy
The key strategy of OTS is to also provide guardrails to the mentors on how to make their interactions with mentees meaningful with anecdotes and stories from scriptures, history (both before and after the cold war), modern day real life happenings or even movies. The idea is to help drill important skills and virtues like decision making, morality, ethics and ambition among others.
An anecdote is a story, usually a short one. And it’s generally written as it was experienced – as a slice of life, a verbal version of a scene from a research cinema verite film. An anecdote is always written from a particular point of view – the person whose experience is being described, or the perspective of someone who saw an event happen. Key elements of the anecdote are:
it’s a short and straightforward story
it usually relates to one incident or event
it focuses on one central idea
Optionally, there is a conflict
it includes key, concrete detail
it may contain quotes
it closes quickly after the climax (it resolves the conflict if there was one).
It requires some kind of punch line, or a snappy or whimsical ending, to make a point, and to make the story stick with the reader/listener. (Van Manen, 1989)
Examples: Cultural Stories
Yudhishthira and the Yaksha Prashna
Theme: Decision-making under pressure, wisdom, righteousness
Anecdote:
During their exile, the Pandavas search for water. One by one, the brothers fall unconscious after ignoring a voice warning them not to drink before answering questions. Only Yudhishthira listens. The voice turns out to be a Yaksha (a celestial being) who tests him with deep philosophical questions.
Lesson:
Yudhishthira’s composed decision to listen and engage respectfully leads to the revival of his brothers.
His answers reveal clarity, ethical reasoning, and humility—critical traits for conflict resolution and sound judgment.

Hanuman’s humility and intelligence make him an ideal mediator and problem-solver.

 Vibhishana Defects from Ravana
Theme: Choosing righteousness over blind loyalty
Anecdote:
Ravana's brother Vibhishana urges him to return Sita and avoid war. When Ravana mocks him, Vibhishana leaves Lanka and joins Rama, despite knowing it’s dangerous.

After being unceremoniously dropped from the Indian team in 2005 following a fallout with then-coach Greg Chappell, Ganguly was written off by critics and even humiliated publicly. For over a year, he was left out of the team, questioned in the media, and seen as a closed chapter.
But instead of fading away, he returned to domestic cricket, grinding it out quietly. In December 2006, Ganguly was recalled to the Indian Test side for the South Africa tour — against all odds. He top-scored for India in the first innings, proved his critics wrong, and by 2007, he became India’s highest run-scorer in ODIs for the calendar year.
Lesson:
This is not just a comeback. It’s a reclamation.
When the system tries to write your ending, write your own second chapter.
Ganguly’s return was built on silent work, not noise. He didn’t complain. He didn’t seek sympathy. He just delivered — again.
